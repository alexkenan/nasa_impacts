# IMPACTS

The Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) is the first comprehensive study of East Coast snowstorms in 30 years. It uses NASA's [ER-2](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-046-DFRC.html) and [P-3B](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/instruments/p3b.html) aircraft for high and low altitude sensing, respectively. The first deployment began on January 17, 2020 and ended on March 1, 2020. IMPACTS samples U.S. East Coast winter storms from microphysics probes and dropsonde capabilities on the P-3, augmented by ground-based radar, multiple NASA and NOAA satellites (including GPM, GOES-16, and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)), and computer simulations. 

I am not sure how COVID-19 impacted this project, but I am sure it had an effect. The P-3B is based at Wallops Flight Facility on the eastern shore of Virginia, and the ER-2 is based at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

There is a NASA "micro-article" [here](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/investigation-microphysics-and-precipitation-atlantic-coast-threatening-snowstorms) that contains more information. The raw data is available at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexkenan/nasa_impacts/tree/main/datasets) and available from the [Data Catalog P-3B](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/p-3-meteorological-and-navigation-data-impacts-v1) and [Data Catalog ER-2](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/er-2-navigation-data-impacts-v1).
