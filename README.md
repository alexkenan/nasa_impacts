# IMPACTS

The Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) is the first comprehensive study of East Coast snowstorms in 30 years. It uses NASA's [ER-2](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-046-DFRC.html) and [P-3B](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/instruments/p3b.html) aircraft for high and low altitude sensing, respectively. The first deployment began on January 17, 2020 and ended on March 1, 2020. IMPACTS samples U.S. East Coast winter storms from microphysics probes and dropsonde capabilities on the P-3, augmented by ground-based radar, multiple NASA and NOAA satellites (including GPM, GOES-16, and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)), and computer simulations. 

All flights appear to have been flown with the P-3B aircraft. I am not sure how COVID-19 impacted this project, but I am sure it had an effect. The P-3B is based at Wallops Flight Facility on the eastern shore of Virginia.

Pictured is Flight 5, an investigation of a Shallow Frontal Zone over the Midwest with snowbands, which occurred on February 5th, 2020.

There is a NASA "micro-article" [here](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/investigation-microphysics-and-precipitation-atlantic-coast-threatening-snowstorms) that contains more information. The raw data is available at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexkenan/nasa_impacts/tree/main/datasets) and available from the [Data Catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/p-3-meteorological-and-navigation-data-impacts-v1).
